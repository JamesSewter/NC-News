## Description
This news website project demonstrates my ability to develop a React-based front-end application. Key features include:

- State management using useState and controlled components
- Routing with react-router-dom for navigation.
- Side effect management using useEffect and handling search functionality with useSearchParams.
- API integration to fetch data and hydrate components dynamically.
- Error handling and loading states to provide user feedback.
- User experience and accessibility considerations, including using Wave for accessibility checks.
- Responsive design with a focus on clarity and usability.
- The project is deployed live for access at: <a href="https://nc-news-js.netlify.app/" target="_blank">NC-News</a>
